# Roblox Resources Collection

I will try to update the lists of libraries and tools over time.
If you have ideas that you think would be a great addition, please consider [contributing](../misc/contribute.md).

(Roblox) Game Development is a multi-lateral craft. It requires more than one skill in order to achieve a final product, and Roblox is no different.

We could try to think about the following core skills:
1. Visual Design 2D
    - This will be all of your icons, emotes, logos and advertising content, as well as a bunch of artork present in your game.
1. Shape / Form Design 3D (Modeling)
    - Roblox is a 3D game, so most of your assets are gonna have to be created by someone, or you can always use a free or paid asset pack.
1. Coding / Scripting
    - Any game needs mechanics, and this is where *real* developers come into play. This is the heart, brain, and everything else of the game, the scripts are what powers your game to generate all the amazing experiences that players have, thru the use of assets created using other skills.
1. UI Design
    - Any menu you have in your game has to look good, be intuitive to use, and responsive.
    - Really close to human interaction and human-oriented design.
1. Marketing / PR person
    - You got a great game, *or one in the works at least*, people will need to know about it right? This is where the **P**ublic **R**elations person comes in.
    - Manages engagement and outreach.
    - Takes care of promoting / marketing channels and manages PR-related communications.
    - Everything Social-Media related.

Now its *hard* to get good at one of these things, so getting proeficient at all of them will prove a challenge.
My advice is play around, check out some things, and start working on what you seem to enjoy working on the most.
